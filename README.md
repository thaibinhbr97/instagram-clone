# instagram-clone
I will create a clone the database structure of a photo sharing social network (Instagram in this case).

I will answers all of these questions:

- Finding 5 oldest users
- Most Popular Registration Date
- Identify Inactive Users (users with no photos)
- Identify most popular photo (and user who created it)
- Calculate average number of photos per user
- Find the five most popular hashtags
- Finding the bots - the users who have liked every single photo
